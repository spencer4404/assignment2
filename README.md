This is a C recreation of the classic Go Fish game

There is a user and computer player who are dealt 7 cards from the shuffled deck and alternate turns, choosing a card to ask the other player for. 
If the player gets the card they asked for, either from the other player or the deck, they go again. Once a player gets all 4 cards of the same suit, they create a "book". 
The first player to get 7 books wins!
